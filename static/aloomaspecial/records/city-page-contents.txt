Mistakes to Avoid When Renting a Dumpster<h2>
Renting a dumpster might seem simple, but there are a few missteps that can cause delays or added costs. Here’s what to avoid:<list>
Choosing the Wrong Size: Overfilling a too-small dumpster can lead to overage fees or multiple hauls. Always consult before booking.^^
Ignoring Weight Limits: Concrete, shingles, or wet yard debris add up fast. Make sure you understand weight restrictions by material.^^
Prohibited Items: Paints, electronics, tires, and certain appliances can’t go in the dumpsters. We’ll give you a list of items to keep out.^^
Placing the Dumpster Improperly: Driveways with overhead wires, sloped surfaces, or soft ground can create issues. Let us help determine a safe placement spot.
Avoiding these mistakes not only saves money, but it also keeps your project on track. Our team will walk you through everything before delivery.
